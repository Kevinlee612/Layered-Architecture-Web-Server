# Programming Assignment 7 In the respective order, these classes are able to:
**BaseResponse Class:**<br >
  - has responseCode and responseString variables inherited by StudentResponseString and StudentResponseObject subclasses <br >
  - Used by Controller class to indicate success or failure of method. <br >
StudentResponseString Class: <br >
  - Used by Controller when getting Student as a string<br >
  - content and listContent String variables contain one or many students in their toString() form<br >
StudentResponseObject Class:<br >
  - Used by Controller when getting Student as an object<br >
  - content and listContent String variables contain one or many students as a Student Object. listContent is an ArrayList of Student objects.<br >
**Controller Class:**<br >
  - The utmost layer of the layered architecture web server<br >
  - Responsible for checking validity of inputs for the methods. (Methods return IResponse with responseCode and responseString
  representative of the outcome)<br >
  - Methods include getStudent(),getAllStudent(),removeStudent(),addStudent(),updateStudent(),getResponse(),setResponse(),setService(), and getService()v<br>
**Service Class:**<br >
  - Receives requests from the Controller class and relays it to the Database class. Will then receive a message from the Database class and relay it to the Controller Class. <br >
  - The middle layer of the layered architecture web server<br >
  - In addition to the methods in the Controller class relating to Students, may instantiate Database Objects.<br >
  - Contains the studList List<Student> that loads the information from the Database.<br >
**Database Class:**<br >
  - The bottom later of the layered architecture web server and contains the data of the Student Objects.<br >
  - Will save changed information to the Database file whenever changes are made.<br >
  - Will keep track of the time at which changes are made so that the Database file does not have to be reloaded after each method.<br >
